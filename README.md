# typescipt_reactimplementation

This program is a simple Typescript implementation on react to see how Typescript can be utilize with React. 

One of the advantage of Typescript is that it allows a programmer to check any errors clearly as the interface can check if there is any incoming data that does not follow the "rule" without creating unncessary lines of erros messages on console.
